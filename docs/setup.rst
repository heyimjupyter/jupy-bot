Getting Started
===========================

Welcome to jupy-bot!

Setting up
-----------------

Start by clicking this link.
- This link contains the permissions that jupy-bot needs access to before it is added to a server. 
- Show step by step indstrucitons with screen shots

Nicely done! jupy-bot is now a part of your server. 

To set up the mix request bot, use the command ``!set-up-mix-bot`. jupy-bot will ask a series of questions to get set up involving the following information:
- What is the name of the mix host role? This is so the bot knows which role to request approval from when users make requests.
- Would you like to set the bot up for 6s mixes, highlander mixes, or both? 
- What are the names of the mix roles? This is so the bot can ping the appropriate role to ask for sign ups when a mix becomes available.
